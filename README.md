# AIIB23 (Airway-Informed Quantitative CT Imaging Biomarker for Fibrotic Lung Disease-MICCAI2023)
![image](images/main.png)
## Context 
Airway-related quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIB) are crucial for examination, diagnosis, and prognosis in lung diseases, while the manual delineation of airway structures is unduly burdensome. Competitors are encouraged to devise automatic airway segmentation models with high robustness and generalization abilities. This challenge is an open-call challenge and new submissions are allowed after the conference.
